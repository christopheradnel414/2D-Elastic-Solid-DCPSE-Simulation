# 2D Elastic Solic DCPSE Simulation
This repository contains the source code for a 2D linear elastostatics solid simulation using particle-based discretization method DCPSE (Discretization Corrected Particle Strength Exchange). This work is part of my undergraduate thesis in computational solid mechanics and this work is also published in JETS 2022 Journal titled "Discretization Corrected Particle Strength Exchange for Steady State Linear Elasticity". 

This repository mainly consists of 3 parts:
1. 2D Linear Elastostatics DCPSE Source Code (main directory)
2. Example Geometry Generation Code (geometries folder)
3. Result Plotter Code (result folder)
4.
